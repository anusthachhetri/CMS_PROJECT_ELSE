80000630,88005824,Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive Versus Escalation approaches for the treatment of Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis,"DELIVER-MS is a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, open label, rater blinded, randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an early highly effective treatment (EHT) approach as first-line (alemtuzumab, natalizumab, or ocrelizumab at clinician and participant discretion), or escalation approach (any approved DMT except the above highly effective treatments, as first-line with or without subsequent escalation to any approved DMT). All participants will have study visits including clinical assessments, cognitive testing, MRI, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at baseline, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months. The aims for this study, in line with the MS Society- James Lind alliance priorities, are: 1) to determine whether an early EHT approach to DMT is more effective than an escalation approach in relation to slowing brain volume loss over 36 months; 2) to assess whether an early EHT approach to DMT is more effective than an escalation approach in relation to PRO and clinical measures; and 3) to assess the safety and tolerability of early EHT versus escalation approaches to DMT in PwRRMS. The study also will follow participants long term for clinical disability outcomes. The randomized study will include 400 participants and the observational study will include up to 400 participants. Participants will be recruited to an equal number of sites in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) and the study steering committee and patient advisory committee will be comprised of investigators, patients, patient advocacy agencies, including representatives from both the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society and National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the NHS, third-party payer representatives and PwMS",test2.json
