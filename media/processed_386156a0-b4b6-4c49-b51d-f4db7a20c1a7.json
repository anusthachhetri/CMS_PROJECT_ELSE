The toxic process resulting in axonal loss is not understood, but inflammation is thought to initiate it. The control of intracellular Na+ is the most energy hungry process in the CNS. Demyelination is expected to increase Na+ entry into axons during impulse activity, and if inadequately reversed is thought to lead to intracellular Ca2+ overload. To attempt to rectify this, clinical trials are on-going attempting to provide neuroprotection by blocking Na+ channels. However, even if effective, residual signalling will be worsened by the medication. We are proposing an alternative strategy. Resting Na+ entry cannot all be through Na+ channels. Our preliminary evidence shows some enters via the NKCC1 transporter, and blocking this transporter will reduce the resting energy requirement while increasing axonal excitability, and so enhance signalling. Bumetanide is a selective blocker of NKCC1, and already widely used to treat congestive heart failure. We will test whether bumetanide is effective in controlling nerve loss in a mouse model of optic neuritis that we have developed and also analyse nerve function in an ex-vivo nerve bath to follow the functional effects of the disease and treatment.","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}},"source":"https://europepmc.org/grantfinder/grantdetails?query=gid%3A%2216.0%22%20ga%3A%22MS%20Society%22&cat="}],"keyword":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"licenseInformation":[{"abstract":{"language":"en","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"},"value":"NOT FOUND"},"source":"http://mssociety.org.uk/privacy"}],"funds":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","hasPart":[{"fundingBodyProjectId":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}]}],"title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"acronym":"NOT FOUND","hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"link":"NOT FOUND","budget":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"status":"CLOSED"}],"fundingDetail":{"fundingTotal":[{"amount":38177,"currency":"GBP"}]},"awardeeDetail":[{"activityType":"Research Organization","affiliationOf":[{"awardeePersonId":"86641291_P_0","emailAddress":"NOT FOUND","givenName":"Mark","familyName":"Baker","fundingBodyPersonId":"NOT FOUND","identifier":[{"type":"ORCID","value":"NOT FOUND"}],"initials":"M.","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Mark Baker"}],"role":"PI","sourceRole":"NOT FOUND"}],"awardeeAffiliationId":"86641291_A_0","departmentName":[{"language":"en","value":"Blizard Institute","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"fundingBodyOrganizationId":"NOT FOUND","fundingTotal":[{"amount":0,"currency":"GBP"}],"hasPostalAddress":{"addressCountry":"GBR","addressLocality":"NOT FOUND","addressPostalCode":"NOT FOUND","addressRegion":"NOT FOUND","postOfficeBoxNumber":"NOT FOUND","streetAddress":"NOT FOUND"},"identifier":[{"type":"ROR","value":"026zzn846"}],"link":"NOT FOUND","name":[{"language":"en","value":"Queen Mary University London"}],"role":"COORDINATOR","sourceRole":"NOT FOUND","vatNumber":"NOT FOUND"}],"classification":[{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1101"}}},{"type":"Annotation","hasSubject":{"preferredLabel":"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)","identifier":{"type":"ASJC","value":"1301"}}}],"relatedOpportunity":[{"grantOpportunityId":0,"fundingBodyOpportunityId":"NOT FOUND","title":[{"language":"en","value":"NOT FOUND","hasProvenance":{"createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","createdBy":"MPS","createdWith":"MPS SERVICES"}}],"description":"NOT FOUND"}],"relatedFunder":{"leadFunder":{"fundingBodyId":501100000381,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"NOT FOUND"},"hasFunder":[{"fundingBodyId":501100000381,"sourceId":"NOT FOUND","sourceText":"NOT FOUND"}]},"hasProvenance":{"wasAttributedTo":"SUP005","derivedFrom":"https://europepmc.org/grantfinder/grantdetails?query=gid%3A%2216.0%22%20ga%3A%22MS%20Society%22&cat=","createdOn":"2025-03-17T00:00:00","lastUpdateOn":"2025-03-18T00:00:00","contactPoint":"Fundingdatateam@mpslimited.com","version":"1","hidden":false,"defunct":false,"status":"UPDATE"},"options":{"additionalProp1":{},"additionalProp2":{},"additionalProp3":{}}}
